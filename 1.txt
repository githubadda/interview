Diff b/w maven N free-style project-----

A maven project is a project that will analyze the pom.xml file in greater detail 
and produce a project that's geared towards the targets that are invoked. The maven 
project is smart enough to incorporate build targets like the javadoc or test targets 
and automatically setup the reports for those targets. There is little configuration required 
for it. See: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Building+a+maven2+project for more information 
on Maven project.

A Free-Style project is a project that can incorporate almost any type of build. While a maven project 
you can only build maven projects, the Free-Style project is the more "generic" form of a project. You 
can execute shell/dos scripts, invoke ant, and a lot more. Majority of the plugins are written to use 
the free-style project. The maven module is limited in that it can't invoke a shell script, or anything 
else just the maven targets. See: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Building+a+software+project for 
more information on a Free-Style project.
